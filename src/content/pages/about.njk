                <p class="about-text">
                    I am a creative developer based in the digital realm, obsessed with the intersection of design and engineering. 
                    With over 5 years of experience in full-stack development, I specialize in building immersive web experiences that leave a lasting impression.

                <p class="about-text">
                    My philosophy is simple: Code is poetry, and the screen is my canvas. Whether it's a complex SaaS platform or an experimental WebGL art piece, I bring the same level of passion and precision to every project.
                </p>
                <p class="about-text">
                    Beyond coding, I explore the worlds of generative art and interactive installation. I believe technology should not just solve problems but also evoke emotions.
